# Sollution-Challenge-KamerInnov
Hi,
Our project is in a community theme. In our country, we often encounter garbage deposits on the roadsides, without the presence of garbage bins, either due to the company managing this area, or due to a very distant distance from the bins for the population. To solve this problem, we have developed a web application that allows an ordinary user to report these garbage deposits to the responsible company, so that it can put bins there. 
The same goes for defective electric poles that are dangerous for the population, but also for the absence of street lights in some streets, causing insecurity.
