# Sollution-Challenge-KamerInnov
Hi,
Our project is in a community theme. In our country, we often encounter garbage deposits on the roadsides, without the presence of garbage bins, either due to the company managing this area, or due to a very distant distance from the bins for the population. To solve this problem, we have developed a web application that allows an ordinary user to report these garbage deposits to the responsible company, so that it can put bins there. 
The same goes for defective electric poles that are dangerous for the population, but also for the absence of street lights in some streets, causing insecurity.

You can see our project on https://kamerinov.herokuapp.com . To access the admin interface go to https://kamerinov.herokuapp.com/admin the user name is justin and the password is secret.

To run it locally, clone the repository, place it on www üìÅ folder in damp server. Go and see the .en file to configure the database. In the file directory run php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate to execute the database migration.
